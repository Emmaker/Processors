# Processors
 A Starbound mod that adds a bunch of machines that process what was once useless into something useful!
 
# For Users
 If you want to use Processors in your Starbound game, this is probably not the place you want to be. If you are using Steam you can download it from here, but if you're not using Steam: download away!
 
# For Modders
 Processors is a very extendable mod made with compatibility with mind. Find the example addon [here](https://github.com/JamesTheMaker/Processor-Addon).
