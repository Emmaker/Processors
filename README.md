# Processors
 A Starbound mod that adds a bunch of machines that process what was once useless into something useful!
 
# For Users
 If you want to use Processors in your Starbound game, this is probably not the place you want to be. If you are using Steam you can download it from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899686368), but if you're not using Steam: download away!
 
# For Modders
 This mod is depricated. Feel free to use any of the scripts in here for your own mods, or look at [Community Framework](https://github.com/Emmaker/CommunityFramework) for my most up-to-date frameworks.
